# noros

NOt a Real OS, just a toy project to get a better understanding of the inner workings of operating systems.

Noros is written in assembly and Rust without the use of any unstable features or crates. It targets x86_64, aarch64 and riscv64gc. More specifically it's tested on QEMU for x86_64, a Raspberry pi 3B+ for aarch64 and a MangoPi MQ-Pro and DongshanPi Nezha STU for riscv64gc. In theory it should work on any x86_64 system, any aarch64 Raspberry Pi and any Allwinner D1-H board.
